# Congratulations!

You have completed _Experiments_ scenario. We learned how to reproduce
pipelines while modifying their parameters through command line via `dvc exp
run`. We created a queue of experiments using `dvc exp run --queue` and run
them at once `dvc exp run --run-all`. We reviewed the experiment results in
a table with `dvc exp show` and brought in the best one to the repository `dvc
exp apply` and committed. 

For more information about experiment management, you can [read the section in
the user guide](https://dvc.org/doc/user-guide/experiment-management). 

This completes Getting Started section. Thank you for joining us.
