Congratulations! This completes this scenario. In the next scenario we'll add
more stages and parameters to the pipeline. We'll also measure and plot the
performance of our work using DVC.

As the last step, let's save the current state of the project to Git:

`git status -s`{{execute}}

`git add data/.gitignore dvc.yaml dvc.lock`{{execute}}

`git commit -m "Created featurization pipeline"`{{execute}}
